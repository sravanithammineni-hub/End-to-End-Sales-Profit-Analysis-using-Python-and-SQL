# End-to-End-Sales-Profit-Analysis-using-Python-and-SQL
Performed end-to-end sales and profit analysis using Python and SQL to identify key profitability drivers, loss-making segments, and discount impact. Conducted data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and SQL-based validation to deliver actionable business insights supporting data-driven decision making.
# End-to-End Sales & Profit Analysis using Python and SQL

## Objective
Analyze retail sales data to identify key drivers of profitability, detect loss-making segments, and support data-driven business decisions using Python-based analytics and SQL queries.

## Business Context
Retail organizations often face declining profitability despite stable sales. This project focuses on understanding sales performance, profit behavior, discount impact, and regional trends to support operational and strategic decision-making.

## Dataset
Superstore Sales Dataset  
(Source: Kaggle)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (MySQL)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
- Data understanding and quality checks
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- SQL-based aggregation and validation
- Identification of key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Business insight generation

## Key Analysis Performed
- Analyzed sales, profit, discount, and customer segments
- Identified underperforming regions and loss-making product sub-categories
- Evaluated the impact of discounts on profit margins
- Segmented customers based on risk and profitability patterns
- Validated analytical results using SQL queries

## Key Insights
- High discount levels significantly impact profit margins
- Certain product sub-categories consistently generate losses
- Regional performance varies despite similar sales volumes
- Profitability depends more on pricing and product mix than sales alone

## Deliverables
- Cleaned and validated dataset
- Python-based analytical notebook
- SQL queries for aggregation and validation
- Actionable business insights

## Note
This project focuses on backend analytics and SQL-driven insights. The outputs are BI-ready and can be visualized using dashboarding tools if required.
